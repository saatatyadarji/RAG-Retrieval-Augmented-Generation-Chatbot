It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable. The algorithm finds the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual values.

It is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and has shown remarkable success in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Deep learning algorithms use a hierarchical approach, where each layer of the network learns to extract more complex features from the input data. This allows the network to automatically learn hierarchical representations of the data, leading to improved performance on tasks that would be difficult or impossible for traditional machine learning algorithms. Deep learning has revolutionized many areas of computer science and has become a key technology in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.\n",

They are particularly effective at handling high-dimensional data, such as images, because they can automatically learn hierarchical representations of the data.\n",
